What on earth am I trying to build:
gastronoma - a recipe manager while making sure the ingredients in your pantry are utilized before it goes bad. Speaking of which, should I add expiration date for ingredients, then??

Oh Lordy...

Unlike my previous two projects, I feel utterly clueless as to where I should begin. But sentiments aside, it's time to roll up my sleeves and dive into this work.

So, to begin with - a few criterias I must achieve.
* authentication using Ominauth (google, specifically)
* JOIN table = recipe_ingredients.
* scope: ActiveRelations - AREL - perhaps ordered by preference or rating of the recipe? wait, wait, let me back up a bit.

Oh dear, I just hope I don't write spaghetti code...
***THE MODELS***
User:
username
email
password
admin
hungry
energy

(wondering, is the hungry and energy really necessary:)
I thought it'd be cool to have hunger and energy levels decrease after making a recipe. But this might be slightly impractical and cumbersome to implement.

Ingredient: - basically the food items the user has in his/her pantry
name
user_id (a carrot that belongs to Joe and a carrot that belongs to Anna is a diff. carrot)
quantity (1 bar of chocolate as opposed to 20 oz of chocolate)

Recipe:
name - e.g. chocolate pudding, deviled eggs
user_id - who made what and who's recipe does it belong to??
time - e.g. 20 minutes or 2 days(except no one would actually make anything that took two days)
description - this would be the instruction to make the recipe
rating - given by any user

RecipeIngredient:
ingredient_id
recipe_id
=== basically the way to join the two tables together. Ingredients can have a lotta recipes, carrot cake, carrot soup, carrot pickle, etc. And Recipes can have many ingredients - chocolate pudding would have chocolate, milk, egg yolks, maybe a touch of salt, etc etc.

DELETE EDIT - only possible if you own the recipe/ingredients

*** USER CAN SIGN IN USING GOOGLE! Get that omniauth implemented!
Scopes: Maybe by how many times a user cooked the same recipe. Maybe they might have made chocolate pudding 41 times and cooked green curry only once. Then the user's recipe index could have the option of scoping the list of recipes by order of preference(frequency of completion). This... and/or by rating. speaking of which, should I let anyone see my pantry(ingredients) or should this be private? Maybe someone might want to keep their Jack Daniels in their cupboard a well-kept secret. Or their special caviar they bought from their honeymoon in France. Yeah, I feel like this stuff should be kept private. No one should know that I have 30 pounds of chocolate in my pantry. That'd be embarrassing.

So -- only users can see their own ingredients.
BUT the recipes that they create/post is public. So, Susan would know Joe made Chocolate cake 41 times. Still embarrassing, but oh well. Accountability is a good thing. Plus, maybe Susan can advise Joe on some indispensable tips to making the most exquisite chocolate cake.

This may be me being overtly ambitious, but honestly, who on earth has the time to fill in every single detailed instruction to their recipe? Nope. We live in a fast world, with impatient people. So SCRAPING TO THE RESCUE!

Websites I would like to scrape...

1. kitchn - looks like a lot of React/Javascript. Could be more complex that I'd like.
when I search quinoa carrot pepper I get zero results, though. Hmm.
https://www.thekitchn.com/search?q=quinoa+carrot+pepper
chocolate pudding is more promising:
https://www.thekitchn.com/search?q=chocolate+pudding

OR a website that is pretty...?
2. Bon Appetit (what's up with %20 after each keyword search query?)
when I search quinoa carrot pepper - this is what I get:
https://www.bonappetit.com/search/quinoa%20carrot%20pepper
3. Food52
In terms of sheer volume, this is the best option. I got 15,339 recipes matching "quinoa carrot rice"
https://food52.com/recipes/search?q=quinoa+carrot+rice
OKAY! I'm going with either Food52 or Bon Appetit. I'll decide later when I actually begin to scrape this.


***A possible problem with scraping***
should I scrape the whole entire page of the recipe?
For example, for FOOD52, there is a snippet of the recipe (optional)
and then a serving (e.g. serves: 2-4)
then a list of ingredients
and lastly a numerically divided... and rather comprehensive list of directions.
AND a photo too! (not always, but most of the time)
After I search, I should just grab the first three or else my already slow app will become even more unbearably slower. For example, the quinoa carrot rice search page put out 22 recipes in its first page... I don't want the app to be retrieving and scraping the detailed recipe of each and every one of those recipes. Yes, just three will do.
Let's try something with a typo... like instead of chocolate, our Mr. Joe is in a rush for his chocolate fix so he writes 'chocolat'. No worries, it still outputs 3,618 recipes
https://food52.com/recipes/search?q=chocolat
OR how about a REALLY BAD typo
like coclate instead of chocolate?
https://food52.com/recipes/search?q=cocloate
no worries, still got three recipes.
and what about super obscure ingredients... Like DURIAN
https://food52.com/recipes/search?q=durian
surprisingly works - got 10 recipes!
OR...... something crazy
like rabbit terrine pistachio
https://food52.com/recipes/search?q=rabbit+terrine+pistachio
I am getting a ton of irrelevent recipes like pistachio cake and summer squash couscous... and grilled aged cheddar cheese?? huh?
but I guess it'll work. Better than a blank page (nil must be avoided at all costs, even though I have to make orange-pistachio biscotti instead of my desired rabbit terrine with pistachio).
which makes me wonder... should I scrape google instead? Google would give me a legit rabbit terrine with pistachio recipe.
https://www.google.com/search?ei=0eQFW878MJXQ9AOIlZ34Cw&q=rabbit+terrine+with+pistachio&oq=rabbit+terrine&gs_l=psy-ab.1.0.35i39k1j0l7j0i22i30k1l2.786.3664.0.4584.17.12.5.0.0.0.148.1249.6j6.12.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.17.1304...0i131k1j0i20i264k1j0i20i263i264k1j0i20i263k1j0i10k1j0i22i10i30k1j33i160k1j0i13k1j0i13i30k1.0.yHAlvX3AyPA
It's just hella long... and possibly error-prone.
So yeah, Food52 it is!
I think I may be spending an inordinate amount of effort adding this added function of scraping websites... but hey. It's cool.

OK -
SOOO to simplify my babbling:
this would be the workflow of my hopefully functioning project.
Open the server.
Greeting message
gastronoma
Login or Signup
Signup - creates user and logs them in.


Users: CREATE - sessions is instantiated

After Login, page has options of:
Look at previous recipe collection
Look at ingredients in my pantry (according to user input)
***once the ingredient is utilized it needs to be decreased in some form... How do I do this? This is too complicated. Think about it, if I use 2 cups of flour for pancakes, do I really need to know I have 2 cups less from my 5 pound bag of flour? Nah. Unncessary info.***
So, how about there is an option of crossing off ingredient if it is completely gone (kind of like the TODO list app that Avi did)

Since... there are a lot of ingredients in the grand scheme of one's kitchen, how about Ingredient's list would be just the key ingredients one would really like to showcase. Like... instead of
flour, salt, butter, sugar... etc etc, just pinpoint the main ingredient. Like - chicken. Steak. And of course, Chocolate. YEAH!

Back to the topic.
The user show page would be something like
User - look at key ingredients that user instantiated in the past
OR create new ingredient that they would like to utilize (something they just bought from the grocery).

Users can see their previous ingredients or ingredients sitting in their pantry... Or create new ingredient that they just bought - but both would lead to a recipe creation.

Get Recipe suited to one's ingredient:
pick ingredients that user would like to user for the meal they're cooking.
For example, let's say they currently have
Plum Carrot Butter that they REALLY REALLY wanna cook with.
Click on those ingredient options.
Then Recipe Scraper will go to FOOD52 and input the string of ingredients...

Something like:
https://food52.com/recipes/search?q=plum+carrot+butter
I'd have to do .join("+") and then concatenate this to "https://food52.com/recipes/search?q="
and then I'd grab the first three recipes... Or should I do first five?
Or should I just do all 22 on the first page?? NAH. that'd take forever. First five sounds reasonable. I would have to make sure it doesn't have nil in the latter part of the Array of recipes. I will make sure... this doesn't break on me! I don't think this will really be an issue as long as the user puts SOMETHING LEGIT in.
After this, scrape the pages of recipes.
The scraped recipe will have...
NAME of recipe
PIC (using URL?? If applicable)
INGREDIENTS (It looks like a pain in the butt because the number and the text is divided... Oh well)
DIRECTIONS also a pain as everything is divided into paragraphs. I'll have to make sure I scrape all the paragraphs accordingly.

By this point, user has... Ingredients can be marked off (I need to add functionality in my Ingredients model to do this) and also has recipes to choose from. Out of five, they could choose as many as they would like. Or wait...
How about I scrape JUST the pic and the title of the recipe first... and then after the user chooses the recipe, it'll trigger functionality that would then lead to scraping the entire recipe. That sounds more reasonable.
Also, stick with 5. No more. No less.
Let's have the ingredients being altered at the show page. Seems a bit too complicated to have all of this in one page - choose recipe, scrape website for recipe... and etc.
After this is done, controller will then render this specific recipe collection from that set of ingredients. I hope it won't be cluttered with all 5 recipes... I need to  do something with CSS to make sure these recipes are nice and readable.

I'm not exactly sure how I'll organize all the views and routing, so let's brief over that right now -
resources: :users
#users would have a show - their own user profile
#new - where they can create NEW user
#create - post request of new, where they are created
#edit - where they can edit their profile (name, password, etc)
#update - the post of edit

resources: :ingredients
#index - all ingredients belonging to user
#show - Shows all previous ingredients (whether used or not ***scoping!!***) AND links to create or edit (which basically means to mark as used) ingredients at this page
#new/create -  creates new ingredient.
#edit/update - marks ingredient as used or etc. Need to scope it so that used ingredients go to another list of "previously used ingredients"
#destroy - where you can really burn to the ground EVERY SINGLE EVIDENCE of that ingredient. Not sure why you would want to do this... but okay, sure. Why not.

resources: :recipes
#index - all recipes of ALL users (visible in sessions/groups - what I mean by this is, a user might have saved 4 recipes after wanting to use carrots. Then this would be a single post containing all those four recipes)
#show - Only my recipe collection.
#new/create - creates new recipe with the current user's ingredients. This is important! It can't be anyone else's collection of ingredients. This is why you must be logged in to do this. If you have no ingredients, then sorry. Go buy some groceries first. (This should be added as a message - if @user.ingredients.empty? return "Hey honey. Looks like you need to visit your grocery store to buy some food. You can't go wrong with buying some eggs and milk. Or avocado and almond milk if you're vegan.")
#edit/update - change the text or ingredients of your recipe collection to your liking. Wait... maybe... Instead of clumping recipes together into a collection based on the ingredient showcased, I should have it separate. Hmm. More on this later.
#destroy - get rid of that RECIPE!!! YUCK! NEVER AGAIN. Never. Again.

resources: :sessions
#destroy - when one logs out
#new - when one logs in
#create - 'post' action of #new

root 'welcome#home'
#Greeter page. Where the magic starts.

Sounds simple enough, right? Let's begin building!! WOOOOHOOO~

A few guidelines for myself:

* do CSS and styling LAST. That's just the cherry on top.
* start with building the models
* then do the sessions and users login
* scrape scrape scrape!
* this would be a good time to add omniauth
* views and controllers setup after this...
* and last but not least, scoping, css, etc.
* stay sane, don't forget to sleep.
* It's 6 pm wed right now, I should be... done before the end of saturday. Hopefully.
